The space for the conveyor belts is divided into squares of $1 \times 1$ unit, in which the user can build conveyor belts. The conveyor belts also have size $1 \times 1$, and the user can only put a conveyor belt exactly inside a square. We will call such objects \textit{blocks}. There are several blocks for conveyor belts, for example a block with a horizontal conveyor belt and a block with a sloped conveyor belt.

The user can also stack blocks. Every block has an height of $1/2$ unit.
