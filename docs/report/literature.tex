There is not a lot of literature on animating or simulating conveyor belt systems. We did not find any scientific papers, but mostly online tutorials on how to animate conveyor belts in 3D modelling tools. This is understandable, since the animation of a conveyor belt, especially when it is not done very realistically, is not really scientifically interesting. We do list some references below however, mostly connected to some concepts we used when building the tool.
