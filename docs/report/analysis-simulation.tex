We saw in Section~\ref{subsubsec:design-goals-simulator} that we have quite a number of constraints on the simulator. We realised that we would need to use a physics library, which is exactly what we will do. Hence, the problem of simulating the movement of pieces of luggage over the conveyor belts is most likely a matter of understanding the API of the library we are going to use and then using it correctly. We may also have to synchronise the speed of the conveyor belts in the library with the animation speed of the conveyor belts in OpenGL.
