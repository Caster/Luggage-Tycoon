\textit{In this section, we will discuss some challenges we might encounter/will encounter/encountered while implementing the program. This will not include very practical stuff, like getting some library to work properly, but things like: converting a point in 2D space (position of a mouse click) to a point in the 3D space of the scene, to determine where the user wants to place a block in the editor. It may also include how we animate the conveyor belts and/or luggage, the simulation of the luggage, et cetera.}

\textit{Some possible challenges may be the ones presented in these proposed subsections.}

\subsection{Building a(n intuitive) GUI in OpenGL}

\subsection{Constructing \& animating conveyor belts}

\subsection{Transforming a 2D point into the 3D model space}

\subsection{Simulating luggage movement in a conveyor belt system}
