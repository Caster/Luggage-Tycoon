We still have several ideas on how the resulting program could be improved. First of all, we have some ideas on how to improve the discoverability of features.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Users do not seem to notice how to drag a conveyor belt ``upwards'' to place a belt higher. This could be improved by giving a visual clue, for example an arrow.
 \item Another building mode to create long conveyor belts more easily.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, there are some features that would make the game experience more interesting.
\begin{itemize}
 \item ``Scanners'' could be added that sort the luggage based on its color. This would make much more interesting levels possible.
 \item In the sandbox mode, the user should be able to place and remove the enter and exit points of luggage, and change its properties.
\end{itemize}
