In this report, we describe the program we created to simulate a system of conveyor belts that transport luggage items.

The system could potentially be used as a tool for modelling for example a luggage system at an airport. However, we have decided to make our application more like a game, since a real simulation system would be very difficult to make and furthermore require specialized domain knowledge about the system to simulate.

Before we started working on the project, we created a mock-up, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mockup}.
