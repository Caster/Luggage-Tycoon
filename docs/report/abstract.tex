\begin{abstract}
  \noindent This report summarises the process of building an editor and simulator for conveyor belt systems. We elaborate on some design decisions and discuss implementation issues we encountered. We also show off the resulting program. The level of detail in this report is such that the general ideas for an implementation should be clear to the reader.
