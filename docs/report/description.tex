\subsection{Requirements}
The program that we built is a combination of an editor and a simulator: the user is able to construct a conveyor belt system in the editor, after which the movement of luggage in that system can be simulated.

\subsubsection{Design goals}
\textit{We will describe in this subsection what our goals are. Think of intuitive user interface, cross-platform, intended audience and possible use cases, \ldots}

First of all, we want the application to have a very intuitive interface, so that new users can easily find the functionality. Furthermore, we want the interface to be efficient, which means that frequent tasks (for example, building a long, straight conveyor belt) can be executed quickly by the user.

\subsubsection{Interaction}
\textit{In this subsection we present the way we implemented the aforementioned design goals or how we facilitate the mentioned intended audience and use cases. We may do so by including some small screenshots already or referring to Section~\ref{sec:results}.}
