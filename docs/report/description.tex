\textit{In this section, we will describe what our program will do and what its intended properties are (good user experience, easy to use, et cetera).}

We will build an application in which a user can design and test a conveyor belt system. The program hence is a combination of an editor and a simulator. The editor is available in the \textit{building mode}, while the \textit{simulation mode} provides the user a way of testing his or her system. The application could potentially be used as a tool for modelling for example a luggage system at an airport. However, due to the large scope of such a system, we want to make the program more like a game, if time permits. Here, the user has to bring luggage from an ``input place'' to a target.

\subsection{Design goals}
\textit{We will describe in this subsection what our goals are. Think of intuitive user interface, cross-platform, intended audience and possible use cases, \ldots}

First of all, we want the application to have a very intuitive interface, so that new users can easily find the functionality. Furthermore, we want the interface to be efficient, which means that frequent tasks (for example, building a long, straight conveyor belt) can be executed quickly by the user.



\subsection{Interaction}
\textit{In this subsection we present the way we implemented the aforementioned design goals or how we facilitate the mentioned intended audience and use cases. We may do so by including some small screenshots already or referring to Section~\ref{sec:results}.}
